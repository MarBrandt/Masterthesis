Unlike the first three generations of district heating, the development of 4GDH involves meeting the challenge of more energy efficient buildings as well as the integration of district heating into a future smart energy system based on renewable energy sources. Following a review of recent 4GDH research, the article quantifies the costs and benefits of 4GDH in future sustainable energy systems. Costs involve an upgrade of heating systems and of the operation of the distribution grids, while benefits are lower grid losses, a better utilization of low-temperature heat sources and improved efficiency in the production compared to previous district heating systems. It is quantified how benefits exceed costs by a safe margin with the benefits of systems integration being the most important.},

  abstract = {To better facilitate renewable energy systems, the district heating sector is currently changing towards lower temperatures and increased cross-sectoral integration. Seasonal thermal energy storage systems alongside heat pumps have received an increasing attention. However, the operation of a seasonal thermal energy storage system alongside a heat pump is more complex than a short-term thermal energy storage system, and as such, several complex simulation models have been developed. These models have shown to be usable for simulating the operation, but due to their complexity are difficult to implement in simulation models that focus on overall energy system analyses. Based on the operation of an existing seasonal thermal energy storage system, this paper provides a simulation method for a seasonal thermal energy storage system with a heat pump that can be utilized in overall energy system simulation models. The simulation method is based on the proven different operational situations of the seasonal thermal energy storage system. The method is shown to be able to approximate the actual operation on an hourly basis and the yearly thermal losses.},

The article describes the approach and the methodology for development of strategy to transform the existing DH system to 4GDH system particularly in cases with low DH systems loads. Two factors (low heat load and low temperatures) are becoming more and more actual. The article analyses the transformation process of the particular small-scale DH system in a parish located in the East part of Latvia. As a result, several transformation scenarios are identified. The technical solutions include replacement of a boiler, heating network reconstruction, heat supply temperature lowering and solar panel installation. Further technical analyses is carried out for system development evaluation and strategy implementation. Results shows that it is essential to evaluate the future energy efficiency measures in buildings when such small scale system is evaluated as it results in lower heat density and higher specific heat losses.},

The aim of the computational model is to investigate the effect of energy reciprocity (energy exchange among the buildings) as well as to find the best way to select the equipment among various candidates (capacities), the pipeline network among the buildings, and their electrical connections. The objective function includes the annualized overall capital and operation costs for the district along with the benefits of selling electricity to the grid. The distributed energy supply consists of heating, cooling, and power networks, several CHP technologies, solar array, chillers, and auxiliary boilers. The performance of the model for poly-generation was evaluated for designing the new part of Suurstoffi district situated in Risch Rotkreuz, Switzerland with seven residential and office complexes under four different scenarios. Allowing heat exchange among the buildings leads to 25% reduction in total annualized cost and 5% reduction in emission compared to the conventional districts. Removing the network and installation of PV and CHPs results in 9% reduction in emission and 11% reduction in cost. Simultaneous heat and electricity exchange results in a higher reduction in total annualized cost equal to 40% of the base scenario.},

This article describes a scenario for supplying Aalborg Municipality’s energy needs through a combination of low-temperature geothermal heat, wind power and biomass. Of particular focus in the scenario is how low-temperature geothermal heat may be utilised in district heating (DH) systems. The analyses show that it is possible to cover Aalborg Municipality’s energy needs through the use of locally available sources in combination with significant electricity savings, heat savings, reductions in industrial fuel use and savings and fuel-substitutions in the transport sector. With biomass resources being finite, the two marginal energy resources in Aalborg are geothermal heat and wind power. If geothermal heat is utilised more, wind power may be limited and vice versa. The system still relies on neighbouring areas as an electricity buffer though. The costs of the scenario are at a comparable level with the reference situation, but with significantly higher needs for investments and lower fuel costs. Implementation of the scenario would therefore have a positive socio-economic impact as investments are more local labour-intensive than fuel supply.},

This is often due to low costs for heat but also due to subsidies for the electricity by CHP plants. Possible changes in subsidies and requirements in the reduction of fossil fuel based CO2 emissions raise an awareness of improving the operational flexibility of fossil fuelled CHP plants. This paper provides a rather simple but detailed methodology of including large solar heating systems in an existing district heating system, where heat is supplied by a large CHP plant. It uses hourly data of load and temperature patterns as well as radiation data and collector efficiency data to determine collector field size and storage size. The possibility of largely independent operation of sub-networks is analysed, which allows different system temperatures. It is demonstrated that a sub-network can operate without a back-up boiler and that both network parts benefit from the interaction.},

The methodology was tested on a district heating system in a municipality in Latvia with 20 000 inhabitants.

Results show the possible energy production from solar energy depends on the area of different solar collector fields and thermal water storage tank volumes, as well as the probable costs of the system.

To fulfil its role, DH technologies must be further developed to integrate renewable resources, create low-temperature networks, and consequently to make existing or new DH networks ready for integration into future STGs. Solar heating is a promising option for low-temperature DH systems. Thermal energy storage (TES) can make the availability of the energy supply match the demand.

In a high latitude country like Finland, the seasonal mismatch of solar availability makes it very difficult to achieve high renewable energy fractions without seasonal storage. In this study, a solar community located in Finland was optimized with respect to energy demand and life cycle cost. To gain better understanding of both technical and economical scaling effects, the optimization was done separately for four cases with 50, 100, 200 and 500 buildings. The study was performed for Finnish conditions using dynamic TRNSYS simulations and optimized with a genetic algorithm, using the MOBO optimization tool. The modeled energy system had solar thermal collectors and solar electric panels for energy generation, two centralized short-term storage tanks and a seasonal borehole thermal energy storage system (BTES) for energy storage, and a ground source heat pump for additional heat generation. The larger communities provided noticeable cost-benefits when aiming for high performance. Larger seasonal storages allowed more direct utilization of seasonally stored heat, lowering the need for the heat pump and reducing electricity demand. Comparing the best and worst performing optimal energy system, annual demand for heating electricity was reduced by 80%. Renewable energy fractions close to 90% for heating were possible for all community sizes, but the large communities could obtain them with about 20% lower costs.},

An optimization solution based on solving multiple Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems has been proposed and implemented in the R programming environment. The operational optimization in a DH system, especially if this system is supplied from a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, is a difficult and complicated task. Finding a global financial optimum requires considering long periods of time and including thermal energy storage possibilities into consideration. There are three important solutions for thermal energy storage: hot water tanks, utilization of thermal inertia of the network itself and utilization of thermal inertia of buildings. Each of these solutions has its advantages and disadvantages, and they can be combined to reach the maximum flexibility at lowest cost. However, modeling of operation with all of the thermal energy storage possibilities in place is a complicated task, since they influence the transient behavior of the network in different ways, and affect each other. On the other hand, optimal planning of heat production can be done only if simple and robust simulation models are available. Proposed solution allows simulation of three kinds of thermal energy storage, with their specific transient behaviors and interactions, at the same time keeping the model simple and ready to be used with a MILP solver. An iterative approach has been applied to non-linear phenomena, which allows solving a non-linear problem by multiple MILP optimizations. It has been successfully implemented in the “R” programming environment and tested on a simple example. The results can prove useful for DH system operators in the near future.},

This work investigates the benefits of applying thermal energy storage in district heating systems to decrease heat load variations, comparing storage using a hot water tank and the thermal inertia of buildings (with similar storage capacity). A detailed techno-economic optimisation model is applied to the district heating system of Göteborg, Sweden. The results show that both the hot water tank and the thermal inertia of buildings benefit the operation of the district heating system and have similar dynamics of utilisation. However, compared to the thermal inertia of buildings, the hot water tank stores more than twice as much heat over the modelled year, owing to lower energy losses. For the same reason, only the hot water tank is used to store heat for periods longer than a few days. Furthermore, the hot water tank has its full capacity available for charging/discharging at all times, whereas the capacity of the thermal inertia of buildings depends on the heat transfer between the building core and its indoor air and internals. Finally, the total system yearly operating cost decreases by 1% when the thermal inertia of buildings and by 2% when the hot water tank is added to the district heating system, as compared to the scenario without any storage.},

This decentralised heat supply has to consider two major output conditions: a stable required feed-in supply temperature and a feed-in heat power equal to the heat output from the solar collectors. However, many installations cannot achieve the second output condition, since severe oscillations appear in the feed-in heat power. This problem can be solved by two different control concepts with either temperature- or flow-control. Detailed measurements from two reference plants are provided for these two different control concepts. One main conclusion is that a robust control system is characterized by the ability to provide required flows and temperatures. The major difference between robust and less robust control is that the supply temperatures and/or flows do not fluctuate even if the input conditions are unfavourable.},

When looking at the district heating systems in detail, many questions still remain unanswered. Is it possible to feed in all the surplus solar energy into the net? How does the solar input affect the network and the other prosumers? Is it sensible from the energy balance perspective? We have studied an existing DHN in an attempt to answer these questions. A simulation model of the DHN in the Southern German city quarter Ludwigsburg-Sonnenberg was developed and extended to include decentralized feed-in of heat from solar thermal collectors to evaluate their potential contribution to network demands. It could be shown that prosumers supply during summer period significantly more heat than they demand, so that the thermal network could operate as an autonomous micro-grid. By comparing the amount of electrical pumping energy that is needed to feed heat to the DHN with usable solar thermal energy, the benefit ratio of feeding heat into the DHN can be quantified.},

This paper investigates the optimal design and operation of distributed energy systems as well as optimal heating network layouts for different economic and environmental objectives. A mixed integer linear programming model was used for multi-objective optimisation to minimize total cost and carbon emissions. Improvements include the coupling of equipment and network modelling across many buildings, detailed CHP operational constraints, the inclusion of network heat losses, and improved modelling of thermal storage. The model was used on a case study consisting of eleven residential buildings and one commercial building for various design scenarios (available technologies, network layout limitations, operating constraints). Design results (capacities, network layouts) and operational results (energy supply breakdowns) are presented. The results show that district heating can deliver emissions savings of 23% over a standard solution for the same cost. The optimal number of heating network links increases as more stringent carbon emissions targets are implemented. Limits on possible network routes have significant impacts on the optimal technology capacities and on operational schedules. Also, commonly neglected constraints on CHP operation cause noticeably more reliance on district heating networks.},

  abstract = {Optimal design and operation of multi-energy systems involving seasonal energy storage are often hindered by the complexity of the optimization problem. Indeed, the description of seasonal cycles requires a year-long time horizon, while the system operation calls for hourly resolution; this turns into a large number of decision variables, including binary variables, when large systems are analyzed. This work presents novel mixed integer linear program methodologies that allow considering a year time horizon with hour resolution while significantly reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. First, the validity of the proposed techniques is tested by considering a simple system that can be solved in a reasonable computational time without resorting to design days. Findings show that the results of the proposed approaches are in good agreement with the full-scale optimization, thus allowing to correctly size the energy storage and to operate the system with a long-term policy, while significantly simplifying the optimization problem. Furthermore, the developed methodology is adopted to design a multi-energy system based on a neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, which is optimized in terms of total annual costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Finally the system behavior is revealed by performing a sensitivity analysis on different features of the energy system and by looking at the topology of the energy hub along the Pareto sets.},

The basic assumption is that district heating and cooling has an important role to play in future sustainable energy systems – including 100 percent renewable energy systems – but the present generation of district heating and cooling technologies will have to be developed further into a new generation in order to play such a role. Unlike the first three generations, the development of 4GDH involves meeting the challenge of more energy efficient buildings as well as being an integrated part of the operation of smart energy systems, i.e. integrated smart electricity, gas and thermal grids.},

Therefore, a MILP (mixed integer linear programming) problem of a distributed energy system is formulated with a weighted multi-criteria objective function including profit and operational CO2 emissions. The considered components include CHP (combined heat and power) units of three different types, a thermal storage facility, a boiler, and district heating pipelines. In a single optimization step placement, quantity and capacity of all components as well as their operation is determined. The computed designs as well as the operation of the energy system are compared under varying weightings and different technology scenarios. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of the investment costs associated with heat storage and of the piping costs for the district heating network. The results favor the construction of heat storage devices over a district heating network. This applies to both environmental impact and cost of energy supply and can be well explained by the decoupling of heat demand and electricity production, which is shown in a correlation analysis.},

Energy, and therefore resources, can be saved at every level of application, from the construction of machinery to the use of transportation fuel, and above all at a systems level considering how different parts and pieces come together to form structures of society. This article addresses the last issue by presenting a model for optimizing the structure and operation of a distributed energy system, or more specifically, a district heating system with its numerous alternatives for production and distribution of heat for a set of widely different consumers. Considering energy supplier technologies and locations, distribution pipe topologies, optional heat storage utilities, and varying consumer demands and weather conditions over a set of different periods, the model can calculate a structure and operational scheme for such system, displaying optimal characteristics in terms of e.g. economy or greenhouse gas emissions. Functionality of the model is demonstrated with a case study regarding the development of an urban area, and an economical optimization of its heating network.},

  abstract = {District heating has been used as heating energy provider for buildings since the half of 19th century. It evolved together with buildings towards higher energy efficiency. Today the energy production systems, hooked up to the district heating network, are able to produce both heating energy and electricity. In some particular cases, also cooling energy is produced. Nowadays it is extensively used in Nordic countries, especially in Finland; subject of this study. Actually, Finnish district heating is facing important challenges, since new European regulations are coming into play affecting both energy generation methods and building energy efficiency. Basically, buildings are becoming more efficient and renewable technologies more cost-effective. Particularly, buildings consume less heating energy, due to high level of insulation, and adopt low temperature indoor distribution systems. Furthermore, new electrical appliances are penetrating into buildings, generating also cooling loads in summer even in cold climates. In addition to these, new effective technologies are available on the market. All these aspects are inducing the district heating to evolve. This study discusses relevant issues for a smooth transformation of the current Finnish district heating towards the future generation. Authors, after an extensive review of the existing district heating operating practices and of the promising innovative technologies network integration, suggested possible and realistic technologies integration scenarios.},

The network description is based on a graph-theoretical method and the Newton algorithm was used for solving the system of nonlinear equations. To validate the model and to demonstrate structural improvement potentials, a case study for a biomass powered district heating network in Scharnhauser Park, Germany was carried out. Taking into account the existing network topology, the consumer stations were redistributed in the model in order to obtain four different load repartitions. By means of three quality indicators (the primary energy factor PEF, the relative importance of losses RiL and the CO2 emissions) it could be shown that the different geographical distributions of consumers within the network have a slight impact on the primary energy use and on the CO2 emissions of the system. The network model was also used to analyse different solar thermal energy supply strategies. It is concluded that the existing collector area can maximally contribute to 0.3% of the total heating energy demand.},

The combination of central solar heating plants with seasonal heat storage enables high solar fractions of 50% and more. Several pilot central solar heating plants with seasonal heat storage (CSHPSS) built in Germany since 1996 have proven the appropriate operation of these systems and confirmed the high solar fractions. Four different types of seasonal thermal energy stores have been developed, tested and monitored under realistic operation conditions: Hot-water thermal energy store (e.g. in Friedrichshafen), gravel-water thermal energy store (e.g. in Steinfurt–Borghorst), borehole thermal energy store (in Neckarsulm) and aquifer thermal energy store (in Rostock). In this paper, measured heat balances of several German CSHPSS are presented. The different types of thermal energy stores and the affiliated central solar heating plants and district heating systems are described. Their operational characteristics are compared using measured data gained from an extensive monitoring program. Thus long-term operational experiences such as the influence of net return temperatures are shown.},

  abstract = {Application of seasonal thermal energy storage with heat pumps for heating and cooling buildings has received much consideration in recent decades, as it can help to cover gaps between energy availability and demand, e.g. from summer to winter. This has the potential to reduce the large proportion of energy consumed by buildings, especially in colder climate countries. The problem with seasonal storage, however, is heat loss. This can be reduced by low-temperature storage but a heat pump is then recommended to adjust temperatures as needed by buildings in use. The aim of this paper was to compare different seasonal thermal energy storage methods using a heat pump in terms of coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pump and solar fraction, and further, to investigate the relationship between those factors and the size of the system, i.e. collector area and storage volume based on past building projects including residences, offices and schools.},

Data sets of measured hourly insolation values were obtained over a 6-month period using pyranometers which received diffuse and total solar radiation on a horizontal plane and total radiation on surfaces tilted toward the equator at 37° and 60° angles above the horizon. Data on the horizontal surfaces were used in the insolation models to predict insolation on the tilted surface; comparisons of measured vs calculated insolation on the tilted surface were examined to test the validity of the sky light approximations. It was found that the Liu-Jordan isotropic distribution model provides a good fit to empirical data under overcast skies but underestimates the amount of solar radiation incident on tilted surfaces under clear and partly cloudy conditions. The anisotropic-clear-sky distribution model by Temps and Coulson provides a good prediction for clear skies but overstimates the solar radiation when used for cloudy days. An anisotropic-all-sky model was formulated in this effort which provided excellent agreement between measured and predicted insolation throughout the 6-month period.},

  abstract = {This article investigates 40 thermal networks in operation in Europe that are able to cover both the heating and cooling demands of buildings by means of distributed heat pumps installed at the customer substations. The technology of thermal networks that work at a temperature close to the ground, can strongly contribute to the decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector and furthermore exploit a multitude of low temperature heat sources. Nevertheless, the nomenclature used in literature shows that misinterpretations could easily result when comparing the different concepts of thermal networks that operate at a temperature level lower than traditional district heating. The scope of this work is to revise the definitions encountered and to introduce an unambiguous definition of Fifth-Generation District Heating and Cooling networks. A drawback-benefit analysis is presented to identify the pros and cons of such technology. The survey on the current networks shows that on average three Fifth-Generation District Heating and Cooling systems per year have entered the heating and cooling market in the last decade. Pioneer countries in such technology are Germany and Switzerland. For some networks, the assessed Linear Heating Power Demand Density results are lower than the feasibility threshold adopted in traditional district heating. High performances and low non-renewable primary energy factors are achieved in systems that exploit a very high share of renewable or urban excess heat sources. With respect to traditional district heating, the surveyed pumping energy consumptions result one order of magnitude higher, whereas the implemented control strategies can be completely different, leading the network temperature to float freely.},

The solar field comprises a flat-plate collector field, an air cooler, a heat exchanger and the corresponding pipelines and interconnections. The main purpose of the solar field is to feed the MED unit with hot water within a specific temperature range using two thermal storage tanks as input buffers to the MED system. The main achievement of this paper is that the developed model provides an adequate tradeoff between complexity and performance.},

Technical flexibility is an essential ability for CHPs to provide secure and economic operation of the IES, as well as to implement a profitable arbitrage in different markets. Operation strategies (OSs) are adopted to utilize the existing technical flexibility in an optimal way. The delivered flexibility is evaluated in terms of the system performance and operation profits. In this paper, a literature review on technical flexibility and characteristics of different CHP technologies is summarized. Moreover, the applications of CHP system flexibility in the IES are discussed from the perspectives of plant owners, system operators and demand side. Literature classified by cost-based and price-based OSs is studied for system operators and generation plant owners respectively. Characteristics of the OSs in terms of the CHP modeling, optimization objectives, constraints and algorithms, etc. are discussed and compared. The study is beneficial to achieve more economic operation of the IES and more profitable operation of the CHP system by system operators and plant owners. Future research work regarding this topic is investigated in the last part.},

  abstract = {Solar district heating (SDH) with seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) is a technology to provide heat for space heating and domestic hot water preparation with a high fraction of renewable energy. In order to improve the efficiency of such systems heat pumps can be integrated. By preliminary studies it was discovered, that the integration of a heat pump does not always lead to improvements from an overall energy perspective, although the operation of the heat pump increases the efficiency of other components of the system e. g. the STES or the solar collectors. Thus the integration of heat pumps in SDH systems was investigated in detail. Usually, the heat pumps are integrated in such a way, that the STES is used as low temperature heat source. No other heat sources from the ambience are used and only that amount of energy consumed by the heat pump is additionally fed into the system. In the case of an electric driven heat pump, this is highly questionable concerning economic and CO2-emission aspects. Despite that fact the operation of the heat pump influences positively the performance of other components in the system e. g. the STES and makes them more efficient. If the primary energy consumption of the heat pump is lower than the energetic benefits of all other components, the integration makes sense from an energetic point of view. A detailed assessment has been carried out to evaluate the most promising system configurations for the integration of a heat pump. Based on this approach a system concept was developed in which the integration of the heat pump is energetically further improved compared to realised systems. By means of transient system simulations this concept was optimised with regard to the primary energy consumption. A parameter study of this new concept has been performed to identify the most sensitive parameters of the system. The main result and conclusion are that higher solar fractions and also higher primary energy savings can be achieved by SDH systems using heat pumps compared systems without heat pumps.},

It overcomes the drawback on intermittency of solar energy and contributes to storing heat from summer to be used in winter. Heat pump and solar collectors with low-temperature storage are the influencing factors to improve the system performance. This paper investigates STES systems integrated with heat pump and solar collectors for heating applications in cold climate zones based on the current available literature. Furthermore, various simulation models and software tools related to STES system were reviewed. This study discusses potential STES systems for space heating system in cold climate zones based on various parameters such as heating demand, climate conditions, and availability of solar resources, storage temperature, energy efficiency, and life cycle cost (LCC). A simple calculation method was applied to demonstrate the potential contribution of different STES options. The double U-tube borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) integrated with ground coupled heat pump (GCHP) and evacuated tube solar collector (ETSC) system was found to be most appropriate for space heating in cold climate zones. The analysis indicated that the system could have higher overall energy efficiency than the traditional space heating systems. Furthermore, a decision support flow chart was presented based on STES options.},

  abstract = {District heating (DH) systems present a great opportunity to increase the proportion of renewable energy used in both heating and cooling. Renewable energy can be integrated into DH to account for heat load and also for power production, which in cogeneration systems is used for both heat generation and transmission. The main aim of this research is to determine whether (and also how) to integrate solar PV panels into DH systems to achieve an economically feasible, flexible energy production solution by using a power-to-heat concept. To reach greater depth in this research, the system dynamics (SD) approach was used. The results show that it is not profitable to install larger PV panels than are needed to provide for summer electricity use. However, use of the power-to-heat concept can expand the flexibility of a solar power system and increase the overall efficiency or economic feasibility when the power generated exceeds consumption. When integrating a larger PV area, the surplus power can either be transferred back to the grid or used for heat production via a heat pump. On average, about 47% of excess power is converted into heat and 53% is sent to the grid. Results show that policies both in the form of subsidies for PV panels and increases in the price of heat can significantly influence the results.},
